Sooner:
- Extensible command processing, parsing (how to resolve NICS vs. FICS
  protocol?) 
- Game and UserSession filters / "formula"
  - define a language and write a parser for it (use guile?)
  - time control
  - rating
  - f-variables (or something better)
- Make NetworkSession* templates, get rid of sessiontype ugliness
- Examined games
- Color switching, rematch
- Rework Chess vs. Game to have some kind of coherent mechanism for
  keeping track of the status of the game, both at a generic level (init,
  in progress, finished) and a game-specific level (winner(s), type of
  win, etc.)
- Extensible variant control, each as a seperate module
	- chess
	- bughouse
	- wild
	- zh
	- stupid knighttour shit
- bughouse should be more of a generic function that takes the variant type
  as well as number of boards.  So we could have quantem :10 0 hourglass 
  fr 4 board bughouse.
- Extensible clock control, each time control as a mod
	- standard (time inc) allowing for sub minute times
	- hourglass
	- x moves in y time
	- x moves in y time, then + z time, sudden death 
- ECO implementation (can this be stolen from an older FICS, or scid?)
- NICS protocol
- Peer-to-peer gaming for new supporting clients
- Bitboards
- NO DAV
- Timeseal or something
- Ratings and finger notes
	- what and how do we want to show ratings
	- How to assign ratings based on game type vs. time control?
	- Filter rating information based on a gamefilter?
	- Find math for rating/RD calculation

Libmchess:
- make parser/lexers reentrant
- add up material
- recognize draws
  - material
  - 50 move rule
  - repetition (how?)
  
Later:
- Multiple server connection (Fics Eics ...)
- Configuration file
- Rework NICSDatabase to implement a query-level interface, to make it
  easier to write interfaces to other SQL databases, and to have some
  infrastructure for thread and connection pooling.  Maybe just use
  ODBC. Should probably find some way to take advantage of cursors, so
  we don't have to lock the connection object for as long.  Also, use
  transactions for operations which affect multiple linked tables.
- Web accessible
	- Ratings
	- Notes
	- Games
	- Stats
- channels (named)
	- Private channels
	- uses ctell instead of tell
- Ban users from obbing your games
- Stats of user progression over time accessable throuch the web.
- custom lists (createlist barbiegirl)
- Ability to add lists to lists (+notify &GM)
- A super mamer thingy, but one thats not annoying
- Formula
	- premove
	- pingtime
	- handle
	- list


Much later:
 2. Adamf at Tue Jun 19, 16:40 EDT 2001: nics should have a summon command 
\   that keeps beeping a person in internvals of v_beepinterval
- libwrap support
- Performance
  - Fix ChessMoveAlgebraic to only test legality if the move is
  ambiguous
  - Bitboards in ChessPosition
- recycle accounts
- 1 time transfer of stats from fics to nics to encourage crossover
- database expiration (deleted users, old games)
- display USCF rating (how to authenticate?)
- Maybe email accounts
- Redundant servers


Ratings
Chess 		#games blah blah blah		avg rating
	standard
	blitz
	lightning
	?quantum?
wild		#games blah blah blah		avg rating
	fr
	w2
	w4
Bughouse	#games	blah blah blah		avg rating
	chess
	wild
	zh
	
So, since there are lots of ratings you can pass a command to finger to get
what you want.  finger /chess bumbler would just show the chess ratings, 
finger by itself would just show the avg rating of the grouped catagories.
Also you should be able to set a variable or formula for your default finger
display.
